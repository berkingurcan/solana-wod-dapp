# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 12, 2026**

## Introduction

Welcome to Solana WoD dApp ("we," "our," or "the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our decentralized application built on the Solana blockchain.

## Our Commitment to Privacy

As a decentralized application (dApp), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This App is designed to minimize data collection and maximize user control over personal information.

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Device identifiers for tracking purposes
- Analytics or behavioral tracking data
- Centralized user accounts or profiles

### Information Handled Locally

The following data is stored locally on your device only:

1. **Wallet Connection Data**
   - Wallet public addresses (when you connect your wallet)
   - Transaction preferences and settings
   - App preferences and configurations

2. **Local Storage**
   - Cached blockchain data for performance
   - User interface preferences
   - Session data (cleared when you disconnect)

### Blockchain Data

When you interact with the Solana blockchain:

- **Public Information**: All blockchain transactions are public and permanently recorded on the Solana blockchain
- **Wallet Addresses**: Your public wallet address is visible on the blockchain
- **Transaction History**: All transactions are publicly accessible through blockchain explorers
- **No Personal Data**: The blockchain does not store personal information unless you explicitly include it in transactions

## How We Use Information

Since we don't collect personal information, we cannot use it. The App functions by:

1. Connecting to your self-custodial wallet (you control your private keys)
2. Interacting with Solana blockchain smart contracts
3. Displaying blockchain data retrieved from public sources
4. Storing preferences locally on your device

## Third-Party Services

### Solana Blockchain Network

- The App connects to Solana RPC endpoints to read and write blockchain data
- RPC providers may log IP addresses and request metadata according to their privacy policies
- We recommend reviewing your RPC provider's privacy policy

### Mobile Wallet Adapter

- The App uses Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter to connect with compatible wallets
- Wallet providers have their own privacy policies
- We do not access, store, or transmit your private keys

### Expo and React Native

- Built using Expo and React Native frameworks
- No analytics or tracking modules are intentionally included
- Standard mobile app permissions may apply

## Data Security

### Your Responsibility

- **Private Keys**: You are solely responsible for securing your wallet private keys
- **Seed Phrases**: Never share your seed phrase with anyone
- **Device Security**: Keep your device secure with passwords/biometrics

### Our Measures

- No central servers storing user data
- Local storage only for app preferences
- No transmission of sensitive data to third parties
- Open-source code available for audit

## Blockchain Transparency

### Public Nature of Blockchain

All Solana blockchain transactions are:

- **Permanent**: Cannot be deleted or modified
- **Public**: Visible to anyone with blockchain explorer access
- **Pseudonymous**: Linked to wallet addresses, not personal identities
- **Traceable**: Transaction history can be analyzed

### Privacy Considerations

- Anyone can view transactions associated with your wallet address
- Your transaction history may reveal patterns or behaviors
- Consider using different wallet addresses for privacy
- Be cautious about linking wallet addresses to personal identities

## Cookies and Tracking

We do NOT use:

- Cookies for tracking
- Analytics services (Google Analytics, etc.)
- Advertising networks
- Behavioral tracking technologies
- Cross-site tracking

## Children's Privacy

This App is not intended for users under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from minors. If you are under 18, please do not use this App.

## Data Retention

- **Local Data**: Stored on your device until you clear app data or uninstall
- **Blockchain Data**: Permanently stored on Solana blockchain (we cannot delete)
- **No Central Storage**: We maintain no centralized database of user information

## Your Rights

As we don't collect personal data, traditional data protection rights (access, deletion, portability) don't apply. However:

- You can clear local app data anytime through device settings
- You can disconnect your wallet anytime
- You control your blockchain interactions
- You can request information about our data practices

## International Users

This App is accessible globally. Blockchain transactions are processed on the decentralized Solana network, which has no geographic boundaries. By using this App:

- You acknowledge the global nature of blockchain technology
- You're responsible for compliance with local laws
- You understand that blockchain data is not subject to regional data protection laws in traditional ways

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect:

- Changes in App functionality
- Legal or regulatory requirements
- Best practices in privacy protection

Updates will be posted with a new "Last Updated" date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## Regulatory Compliance

### Cryptocurrency Regulations

- Users are responsible for complying with local cryptocurrency regulations
- Some jurisdictions restrict or prohibit cryptocurrency use
- Tax obligations may apply to cryptocurrency transactions

### Data Protection Laws

While we don't collect personal data, we recognize:

- GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- Other regional data protection laws

The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means traditional data protection frameworks may not fully apply.

## Risks and Disclaimers

### Blockchain Risks

- **Irreversible Transactions**: Blockchain transactions cannot be undone
- **Smart Contract Risks**: Bugs or vulnerabilities may exist
- **Network Fees**: Transactions require SOL for gas fees
- **Value Volatility**: Cryptocurrency values fluctuate

### Privacy Risks

- **Public Addresses**: Your wallet address is publicly visible
- **Transaction Analysis**: Sophisticated analysis can link addresses
- **Metadata Leakage**: RPC providers may log connection data

## Contact Information

For privacy-related questions or concerns:

- **GitHub**: [Submit an issue on our repository]
- **Email**: [Contact project maintainers]

Please note: We cannot delete blockchain data or provide traditional data protection services due to the decentralized nature of the technology.

## Transparency

This is an open-source project. You can:

- Review the source code
- Audit data handling practices
- Verify no hidden tracking or data collection
- Contribute to improving privacy features
